# Overview

A demonstration of my skills in Python for the purposes of proving that I have a basic understanding of the Python programming language. By starting from what I know, I hope to create a foundation to then learn how to replicate this in other programming languages.

This is a Hello World script written in Python.

This script prints the message "Hello World!" to the user.

Here is the walkthrough for the script:
